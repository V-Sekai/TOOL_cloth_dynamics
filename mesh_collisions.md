# Arbitrary Mesh Collision and Differential Cloth with FCL

In the context of your inquiry about implementing arbitrary mesh collision and differential cloth using the Flexible Collision Library (FCL), I recall examining this library for a similar purpose. However, due to time constraints, I didn't get the chance to utilize it in my project.

The FCL is a powerful tool that can handle complex geometries and enable efficient collision detection. It could potentially be a good fit for your needs.

Here's the link to the library: [Flexible Collision Library (FCL)](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl)

If you decide to proceed with adding arbitrary mesh Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) to the library, I'd be more than happy to provide support. I can answer any questions you might have and assist you through Zoom calls. Please feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or guidance.
